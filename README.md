# HandLanguageVisualizer
A visual interpreter for Hand Language

I came across [this](https://github.com/jesus-seijas-sp/hand-challenge) challenge. It basically asks you to build a "hand language" interpreter, which is just Brainfuck but using hand emojis.
Making this interpreter is an easy task, so I decided to make it more complex by visually showing what the language is doing. I have no experience working with canvas, so sorry if drawing code is a mess.
